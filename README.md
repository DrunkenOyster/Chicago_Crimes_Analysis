# Chicago Crime Analysis Project

**Chicago Crime** is a file I worked on for a school project. The aim of this project was to analyze a dataset of crime data in Chicago and use data visualization tools to present the results.

## Project Overview
In this project, I was tasked with answering specific questions based on the data provided. My work involved:

- Analyzing the dataset to uncover patterns and insights.
- Using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to create various visualizations such as graphs and charts to clearly present the findings.
  
## Tools Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for data analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For creating graphical visualizations.

## Purpose
This project was part of my coursework, designed to enhance my skills in data analysis, visualization, and to understand crime patterns in Chicago through data.

Feel free to explore the files and visualizations for a deeper understanding of the analysis.
